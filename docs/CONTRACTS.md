# Public Contracts

This template is an opinionated reference app built on two reusable seams: a
machine-readable CLI contract and a small C TUI menu primitive. A "contract" here is a
stability promise. The surfaces listed as *supported* are safe to build automation or
downstream code on; everything else (help wording, colors, file layout, internal
helpers) can change without notice.

Keep mechanism in these seams. Keep local workflow policy in the generated app.

## CLI contract

`opencli.json` is the checked-in CLI contract, and the binary prints the same document:

```bash
myapp opencli
```

`zig build test` fails when `myapp opencli` and `opencli.json` drift, so command and flag metadata must change in the C tables *before* the spec does. The canonical sources:

| Source | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `src/cli/opencli_contract.c` | OpenCLI info, conventions, root command arguments, extra examples, and metadata |
| `src/cli/commands.c` | `--help`/`--version` metadata, command names and summaries, global value options such as `--config`, command arguments and options, examples, terminal requirements |
| `src/core/config.c` | Global flag metadata |
| `src/core/error.c` | Public exit codes and descriptions |

After editing those tables, regenerate the artifact and re-run the tests:

```bash
zig build run -- opencli > opencli.json
zig build test
```

**Supported (stable to depend on):**

- global options before the command
- command names, arguments, options, and examples in `opencli.json`
- public exit codes in `opencli.json`
- `--json` responses that include `format_version`
- JSON output as the default whenever stdout is not a terminal; pass `--plain`
  before the command to keep human text under pipes or redirection
- `myapp opencli` and `myapp --json opencli` both write the same schema document because the contract is already JSON
- stdout for command output, stderr for errors and diagnostics
- config precedence: CLI args > environment > config file > defaults

## Dispatch modes

The binary chooses its front-end from argv shape and terminal attachment:

| Invocation | Condition | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `myapp` | stdin and stdout are TTYs | Launch the interactive TUI menu. |
| `myapp <command> ...` | any terminal shape | Dispatch the named CLI command through the command table. |
| `myapp` | no interactive TTY | Read a headless JSON request object from stdin and dispatch it. |

`--help` and `--version` are immediate-exit flags and keep their human-readable
stdout behavior even under pipes.

### Headless JSON request protocol

Bare non-TTY invocation is an experimental, versioned machine surface for agents
and CI wrappers that prefer stdin/stdout over shell-token construction. The
request shape is:

```json
{
  "command": "hello",
  "args": ["Alice"],
  "flags": {
    "debug": false,
    "quiet": false,
    "verbose": false,
    "json_output": true,
    "plain_output": false,
    "no_color": false
  }
}
```

Only `command` is required. `args` defaults to an empty array. `flags` uses the
same JSON keys as config files and currently accepts booleans only. Unknown flag
names are rejected. String values accept RFC 8259 escapes, including `\uXXXX`
(with UTF-16 surrogate pairs), and are decoded to UTF-8; an escaped NUL
(`\u0000`) is rejected because it cannot be represented in the C-string
arguments.

Responses are whatever the dispatched command writes in JSON mode and therefore
include the same `format_version` convention as `--json` command output. Parse
and dispatch errors are written to stderr as JSON messages and use the public
exit codes from `src/core/error.c`. Empty stdin is a `APP_ERROR_MISSING_ARG`
failure.

**Private (may change without notice):**

- exact help text, example prose, spacing, and colors
- log wording and timing
- internal `app_error` values not listed as public exit codes
- source layout and private helper functions

## TUI menu contract

`zig build tui-menu-lib` builds the narrow reusable primitive and installs:

```text
zig-out/lib/libtui-menu.a
zig-out/lib/pkgconfig/tui-menu.pc
zig-out/include/curspan/core/error.h
zig-out/include/curspan/core/types.h
zig-out/include/curspan/tui/tui.h
zig-out/include/curspan/tui/tui_menu.h
zig-out/include/curspan/tui/tui_progress.h
```

**Supported:**

- the `tui_init()` / `tui_cleanup()` lifecycle from `tui.h`
- `tui_set_color_enabled()` to set the color policy before `tui_init()` — the
  generated app passes `app_use_colors(config)` so the TUI honours the same
  `NO_COLOR` / `FORCE_COLOR` / `CLICOLOR(_FORCE)` / `APP_CLI_COLOR=never` /
  `--no-color` / `--plain` inputs as the CLI; left unset, the TUI falls back
  to terminal capability alone
- `tui_show_menu()` from `tui_menu.h`
- `tui_menu_config_t`, `tui_menu_item_t`, and `tui_menu_result_t`
- the pointer-lifetime rules documented in `tui_menu.h`
- separators, disabled items, mnemonics, search, numeric jumps, resize handling, and interrupt handling
- the `TUI_MENU_VERSION` compile-time macro (with `TUI_MENU_VERSION_ENCODE`) for feature-detecting the seam across template updates

The archive is self-contained: it bundles the shared UI primitives the menu
needs (`text_layout.c`, `design_tokens.c`), so linking it requires only a
curses library. The archive is also self-contained for a foreign toolchain — it
is compiled with `sanitize_c = .trap`, so its UBSan checks lower to inline traps
instead of calls into Zig's UBSan runtime, and a plain `cc` link resolves with
no `__ubsan_handle_*` symbols even from a Debug/ReleaseSafe build.

The install ships a pkg-config manifest (`tui-menu.pc`, version tracking
`TUI_MENU_VERSION`). Link a consumer either explicitly or via pkg-config:

```bash
# explicit
cc app.c -Izig-out/include \
   -Lzig-out/lib -ltui-menu \
   $(pkg-config --libs ncursesw) -o app

# via the installed .pc (use --static to pull in -lncursesw)
PKG_CONFIG_PATH=zig-out/lib/pkgconfig \
cc app.c $(pkg-config --cflags tui-menu) \
   $(pkg-config --libs --static tui-menu) -o app
```

**Private:**

- `tui_menu_internal.h` and `tui_menu_state_t` internals
- cell-by-cell rendering details
- exact colors, palette slots, and color-pair mappings (the CLI and generated
  TUI intentionally share the same env policy and semantic roles, but not a
  stable color ABI)
- exact footer/help text inside the alternate screen
- terminal-test snapshots, except where a test names a specific invariant

## Not yet

Do not add a plugin API, stable ABI promise, long-running headless service, or
broad TUI framework until multiple generated projects need the same unsupported
behavior. Prefer a CLI/spec addition or a small library function before any
in-process extension system.
